Necrotic was my full time job from March. 2016, until August. 2017, when I went to college.
I have wiped all sensitive data files, and included a "Dummy" character who's password you must set to use.

If you do make anything interesting with the project, please send me media! 
I'd love to see the release taken further.

If you need to contact me, the best way is email, or discord.
