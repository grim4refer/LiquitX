#1: When you want to put your server online, search for "localhost" in the client and replace it with your server's address. (Configuration.java)


#2: Regenerate RSA keys... 
Search for "//REGENERATE RSA" in the source.
You should find 1 result in client, and 1 result in server.

Use the RSAKeyGenerator class to do this.

Do NOT use the included RSAPrivateKeys.txt and RSAPublicKeys.txt, they were generated at release.
Anyone who downloads the same source as you will have them.
